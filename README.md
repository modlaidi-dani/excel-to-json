Get data from excel file 
#### introduction :

I have developed APIs that allow a user to store, retrieve, and generate data from Excel files. The main features include:

- Storing Excel files: Users can upload their Excel files via the API to store them on the server.
- Retrieving Excel files: Users can download their stored Excel files from the server.
- Generating APIs from file data in JSON: Users can generate APIs from data extracted from their Excel files in JSON format.
- Generating data from an Excel file without prior storage or authentication: Users can also generate data from an Excel file without having to store it beforehand or be authenticated.
These APIs offer users flexibility and ease of use in managing their Excel data effectively.
